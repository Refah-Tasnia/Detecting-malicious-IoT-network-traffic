# Detecting-malicious-IoT-network-traffic
This is a Machine Learning (CSE445 course) group project done in my final year at North South University for the Bachelor of Science in CSE program.
The aim of this project is to detect malicious network traffic in IoT devices via ML-trained models and the project report
"CSE445_Project_Report__Detecting_malicious_IoT_network_traffic.pdf" elaborates on the goals met by this project and the analysis of project outcomes.
